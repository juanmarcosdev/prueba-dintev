  <li><h4>Technologies used:</h4>Shell (but the config files were made for configuring PHP and some other things)</li>
  <li><h4>Approximate date:</h4>Second semester of 2020</li>
  <li><h4>Purpose:</h4>This was a test that I did to get a part-time job in the area of DINTEV (Division of New Technologies and Virtual Education) within the University. More than anything, it was installing and configuring PHP and other requirements to correctly install a version of Moodle.</li>
